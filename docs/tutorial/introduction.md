Welcome to _the_ Neuxus tutorial! If you're new to Nexus and want a guided learning journey, this is the place! Through a handful of chapters we're going to be building just enough of an e-commerce app to give you an overview of Nexus; what it is and what it can do.

Throughout this journey, we'll be making a few minor assumptions about your toolchain to keep the content flowing:

- Using `npm` as the package manager.
- Using a \*nix OS
- Using VSCode

If you're using another set of tools, like Yarn on Windows with Sublime Text, that's totally fine and welcome! Just know that at you'll occasionally need to adapt minor instructions to your situation.

Thanks for checking out Nexus, we hope you're as excited to learn about it as we are to show it to you! :rocket:
